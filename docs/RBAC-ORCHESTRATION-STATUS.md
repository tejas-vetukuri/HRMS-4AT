# RBAC / Approvals Orchestration Status

Durable, cross-session task tracker (God-Agent playbook §9). One row per task.

| ID | Status | Worktree branch | Worker | Retries | Merge SHA |
|----|--------|-----------------|--------|---------|-----------|
| APP-1 | merged (local RBAC, pre-pipeline; done by orchestrator before playbook adopted) | — | — | 0 | e1f3e04 |
| APP-2 | merged (local RBAC, pre-pipeline) | — | — | 0 | e1f3e04 |
| APP-3 | in worker | (isolated worktree) | worker-app3-approvals-inbox (claude) | 0 | — |

Notes:
- Playbook's `docs/JIRA-SUBTASKS-RBAC-todo.csv` is absent; backlog is the live
  goal + hive tasks.json. Blocked-on-human cards (T06/T07/T14/T16/T17/T19/T20)
  are unchanged and not in the pipeline.
- Spawn providers available here: claude/codex/cursor/antigravity (no OpenCode);
  workers are isolated Claude workers.
- Git rule enforced: author Nandini Velamuri <krishnanandiniv@gmail.com>, no AI
  mention / co-author trailer in any commit (§8).
