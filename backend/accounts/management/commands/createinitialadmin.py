"""docs/TASKS.md P1-E1-08 — the production bootstrap: creates the first HR
Admin (or equivalent) user from env vars if one doesn't already exist, and
does nothing (not error) if run again. This is how the very first login into
a fresh environment happens (dev, CI, staging, prod alike), so it has to be
idempotent and safe to run on every deploy, unlike seed_demo_users (disposable
test fixtures) or import_employee_directory (a one-time real-roster load)."""
