"""Loads the real employee roster from data/employee_directory.csv into
Department/Designation/Location/Employee. Idempotent (get_or_create by email/
name), safe to re-run as the CSV is corrected or extended.

This repo is public. data/employee_directory.csv is gitignored
(backend/**/management/commands/data/ in .gitignore) and must stay that way —
it is real names and real emails, including a few personal (non-corporate)
addresses. The file lives in a private location outside this repo; fetch the
current version from there before running this command, don't try to source
it from git history or re-add it with -f.

Deliberately leaves Employee.manager unset for everyone — the org tree/
reporting hierarchy is a separate follow-up (apply_org_tree, not built yet)
once that data is available, so this command never has to guess at it.

Every created User gets an unusable password (Django's set_unusable_password)
rather than a shared default — these are real people's provisioned accounts,
not disposable test fixtures like seed_demo_users, so a guessable shared
password would be a real credential weakness, not a convenience. No Role is
assigned either: mapping ~90 real job titles to Employee/Manager/HR Admin/
Finance is a business decision for whoever owns that call, not something to
infer from a designation string.
