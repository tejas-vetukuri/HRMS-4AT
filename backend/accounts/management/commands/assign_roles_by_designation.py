"""Assigns each employee a Role based on their Designation. A one-time
business decision (which title maps to which role), not something inferred
generically — see DESIGNATION_TO_ROLE below, confirmed with the stakeholder
rather than guessed:

- CEO/Managing Partner/Associate Partner/Head of Consulting -> a new
  "Executive" role (created here if missing): org-wide employees.read only,
  deliberately NOT roles.manage — RBAC administration stays HR Admin's job,
  not a general executive one.
- Manager/Assistant Manager/Product Development Manager -> Manager
- HR Lead/Talent Acquisition Lead -> HR Admin
- Finance Executive -> Finance
- Everything else (Senior I/II/III, Staff, Senior Staff, Contractor,
  Application Development and AI Engineer) -> Employee

Idempotent — only touches users whose role actually needs to change, and
every change is audited (docs/REQUIREMENTS.md's "audit everything"),
consistent with role changes made through UserViewSet.
