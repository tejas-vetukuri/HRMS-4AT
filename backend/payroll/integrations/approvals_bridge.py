"""Bridge between payroll's multi-stage approvals and the shared approvals
engine (core primitive #3) so payroll items appear in everyone's Approvals
inbox.

Payroll keeps its own rules (stage order, stage permissions, maker-checker,
audit). The engine routes one request to one named approver, so each payroll
stage is mirrored by one engine Request while that stage is pending:

- stage opens      -> open_stage() raises an engine Request for its approver
- decided in inbox -> on_request_decided() applies it through payroll's service
- decided in payroll -> close_stage() resolves the engine Request to match

Approver: the pay group's named finance_reviewer / final_approver, else the
first active user holding the stage permission who is not the preparer."""
