"""Primitive #6 — File storage (docs/ARCHITECTURE.md). One `Document` row per
stored file, attached to some entity by (entity_type, entity_id). The row IS the
abstraction — access is derived from a per-entity_type matrix (see access.py),
not from a storage interface layer. Bytes live on disk (MEDIA_ROOT) now; swapping
to S3 later is a storage-backend change, not a schema change."""
