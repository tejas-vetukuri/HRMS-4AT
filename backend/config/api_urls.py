"""Mounted at /api/v1/.

Core apps are included explicitly. Every other installed app is mounted
automatically if it has an `api_urls.py` exposing `urlpatterns`, so a plug-in
module only has to be added to INSTALLED_APPS and ship `rbac.py` (its
permissions) and `api_urls.py` (its routes). No core file needs editing.
