"""Live verification of the employee and organisation module.

    python manage.py verify_employees [--html] [--open]

Runs against the real API and database, on a fictional company built for the run and
rolled back afterwards, so it is safe on the dev database. It checks: directory reach at
all seven levels (the plug-in conformance kit), managing the organisation structure,
the employee lifecycle (joining, leaving, returning), personal details and who may see
them, and self-service. It also prints a data-quality summary of the employees already
in the database (counts only, no names).
