"""core/scope.py::resolve_employee_scope — the single most important function in
the codebase. It is the direct fix for a confirmed, live IDOR vulnerability (any
employee could previously read any other employee's data by changing an ID in a
URL). Every employee-keyed queryset in every module must filter through this
function's result rather than re-implementing any tier's logic locally:

    Employee.objects.filter(pk__in=resolve_employee_scope(user, "leave.approve"))

See docs/ARCHITECTURE.md's "Scope resolution" section for the design this
implements, and docs/REQUIREMENTS.md §0 for what each tier means in product terms.
