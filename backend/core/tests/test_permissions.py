"""ScopedEmployeePermission — code-review fix for a pk type-confusion bug:
has_object_permission used to compare obj.pk directly against the scoped
Employee queryset, which is only correct when obj IS an Employee. Since the
class is documented as generic for any employee-keyed model, a future
non-Employee model sharing a pk value with an in-scope Employee would have
been granted/denied access based on coincidental ID overlap between
unrelated tables."""
